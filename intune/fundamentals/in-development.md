To help in your readiness and planning, this page lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information on this page:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's a preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this page to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's new](whats-new.md) page are updated periodically. Přijďte se tedy znovu podívat, jestli nejsou k dispozici nové informace.
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

> [!NOTE]
> This page reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in a future release. Dates and individual features might change. This page doesn't describe all features in development.
